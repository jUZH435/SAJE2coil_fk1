# Introduction

The data that we are going to use for this exercise is published in the mBio paper [@niggli2023mbio]. 
It can be found online on: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23578086.v1
It describes the OD600 (growth) of the *Staphylococcus aureus* strain **JE2** in different media.

# Reading in Data and Plotting Growth Curves

```{r load data, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
fN <- "JE_growth_final.txt" # us this txt file that is copy pasted spread sheet from excel tab separated 
print(fN)
```

```{r print data, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
print("these are so called junks of code, you may include them to be shown in the rendered document (html here)
      each junk has a unique name next to it and then some additional arguments")
print(fN)
```
