# Play around with RMardown

Try to play around with Rmarkdown. You can find a cheatsheet in RStudio under Help. 

![This is a screenshot showing where you find the Rmd cheatsheets](../img/CheatsheetsInRStudio.png){width=350px}
*RStudio has also linked Cheatsheets for Rmarkdown in the Help section*

You may include any other picture or do any other thing you like.
